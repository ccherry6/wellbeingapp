# Quick Backup & Restore Guide

## Backup Location

Your working backup is saved at:
```
/tmp/cc-agent/56043404/backups/working-build-2025-12-06/
```

## What's Backed Up

✅ **275 files** including:
- 35 source code files
- 161 database migration files
- 6 edge functions
- 21 documentation files
- All configuration files
- iOS project files

✅ **Compressed archive** (1.2MB) for easy transfer

## Quick Restore

### Option 1: Use the Restore Script (Recommended)

```bash
cd /tmp/cc-agent/56043404/project
bash RESTORE_FROM_BACKUP.sh
```

This will automatically:
1. Clean the current directory
2. Copy all files from backup
3. Install dependencies
4. Build the project

### Option 2: Manual Restore

```bash
# Navigate to where you want to restore
cd /path/to/restore/location

# Copy the backup
cp -r /tmp/cc-agent/56043404/backups/working-build-2025-12-06/* .

# Install and build
npm install
npm run build
npx cap sync ios
```

### Option 3: Extract from Archive

```bash
cd /path/to/restore/location
tar -xzf /tmp/cc-agent/56043404/backups/working-build-2025-12-06/thrive-wellbeing-backup.tar.gz
npm install
npm run build
```

## Verify Backup Integrity

```bash
# Check if backup exists
ls -lh /tmp/cc-agent/56043404/backups/working-build-2025-12-06/

# Count files (should be 275)
find /tmp/cc-agent/56043404/backups/working-build-2025-12-06 -type f -not -name "*.tar.gz" | wc -l

# Test archive
tar -tzf /tmp/cc-agent/56043404/backups/working-build-2025-12-06/thrive-wellbeing-backup.tar.gz > /dev/null && echo "✅ Archive is valid"
```

## What This Backup Contains

- ✅ Verified working production build
- ✅ All database migrations tested and applied
- ✅ iOS app ready for Xcode
- ✅ Clean (no duplicate files)
- ✅ All TypeScript compiles successfully

## What's NOT Included

These are excluded to save space (easily regenerated):
- `node_modules/` - Run `npm install`
- `dist/` - Run `npm run build`
- `ios/App/Pods/` - Regenerated by Xcode
- `.git/` - Version control history

## Important After Restore

1. Configure your `.env` file with Supabase credentials
2. Run `npm install` to regenerate dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` to verify build works
4. For iOS: Open `ios/App/App.xcworkspace` in Xcode
