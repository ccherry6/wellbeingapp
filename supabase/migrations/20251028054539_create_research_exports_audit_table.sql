  # Create Research Exports Audit Table

  1. New Tables
    - `research_exports`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique identifier for each export
      - `exported_by` (uuid, foreign key to auth.users) - Coach who performed the export
      - `export_date` (timestamptz) - When the export was generated
      - `start_date` (date) - Start of date range for exported data
      - `end_date` (date) - End of date range for exported data
      - `participant_count` (integer) - Number of research participants included
      - `research_codes` (text[]) - Array of research codes included in export
      - `fields_exported` (text[]) - Which data fields were included
      - `notes` (text) - Optional notes about the export
      - `created_at` (timestamptz) - Timestamp of record creation
  
  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `research_exports` table
    - Only authenticated coaches can insert export records
    - Only authenticated coaches can view export history
  
  3. Purpose
    - Maintains audit trail of all research data exports
    - Supports compliance with research ethics requirements
    - Allows tracking of when and what data was exported for analysis
